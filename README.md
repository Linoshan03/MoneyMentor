##  How the Agent Works

Money Mentor follows the **ReAct (Reason + Act)** agent pattern, where the AI agent:

1. **Reasons** about the user’s question using its internal knowledge
2. **Acts** by deciding whether to take a tool-based action—like searching the web
3. **Observes** the result (e.g., from Tavily Search)
4. **Thinks** again and continues reasoning
5. **Responds** with a final, fact-based answer

This cycle allows the agent to combine both **tool usage (action)** and **LLM reasoning** to produce accurate and useful financial advice.
